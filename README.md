# ReSi_Rendered-Embodiment-of-Social-Interactions
ReSi is an interactive neuro-feedback audio-visual installation. An abstract exploration of human interaction that uniquely blends neurotechnology, psychophysiology, social neuroscience, and hyper scanning—the measurement of brain activity from multiple people at the same time—to artistically conceptualize social interactions.
